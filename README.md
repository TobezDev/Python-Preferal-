# Python-Preferred
A Python template with all the unnecessary, silly errors removed.

## Using this template
To use this template:
- Click the **use this template** button in the top right of the [repository's homepage](https://github.com/TobezDev/Python-Preferred).
- Select **Open in a codespace**.
- Move both the **pyproject.toml**, **poetry.lock** files and the **.upm** folder to a new folder named **packager-files**.
- **Using file manager:**
  - Right-click this folder in your codespace sidebar;
  - Select the **use this folder for packager settings** option;
  - Your codespace should reload. If it doesn't, reload it manually.
- **Using terminal:**
  - Open a new terminal using your device's shortcut;
  - Enter in ` > Select new packager files root `;
  - Select your new ` packager-files ` folder;
  - Reload your workspace if it does not reload automactically.<br>
**The above instructions will setup a codespace for use with this template. You can then fork this codespace to a local project or other project host to use it there.**
**If you are using Replit, select the [Built-In Replit Template](https://replit.com/@TobezEdu/Python-Removed-Unnecessary-Errors?v=1) instead.**

## Known Issues

  - ` OperationNotFoundException `:  You have a bugged Codespace instance - create a new one or attempt to troubleshoot the issue.
  - ` IncorrectFormatException `: I have only seen this once, during development, and is has not appeared again. [Contact me](#contact) if you encounter this error.
